<h1>Pitch for HypeMachine</h1>

<p>A browser extension for HypeMachine.</p>

<h2>Installing as Chrome Extension</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download/clone the repository to your machine, you can do so from the right hand side of this page.</li>
<li>Open Google Chrome and go to your Window > Extensions or just go to chrome://extensions/.</li>
<li>Make sure &ldquo;Developer mode&rdquo; is checked in the top right of the page.</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Load unpacked extension&hellip;&rdquo; and select the pitch folder which should now be on your machine.</li>
</ol>


<p>I will release it on the Chrome Extension store once I feel it has enough time spent on it, right now it&rsquo;s purely a side project. It will stay on GitHub even when it&rsquo;s on the store though, to allow people to contribute or develop on top of.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>I welcome contributions to this project, the javascript side of things could use some love especially. To keep things simple for me I run all compiling through CodeKit but obviously you can do it manually if you wish.</p>
