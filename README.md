# Pitch for HypeMachine
A browser extension for HypeMachine.

## Installing as Chrome Extension

1. Download/clone the repository to your machine, you can do so from the right hand side of this page.
2. Open Google Chrome and go to your Window > Extensions or just go to chrome://extensions/.
3. Make sure "Developer mode" is checked in the top right of the page.
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the pitch folder which should now be on your machine.

I will release it on the Chrome Extension store once I feel it has enough time spent on it, right now it's purely a side project. It will stay on GitHub even when it's on the store though, to allow people to contribute or develop on top of.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to this project, the javascript side of things could use some love especially. To keep things simple for me I run all compiling through CodeKit but obviously you can do it manually if you wish.
